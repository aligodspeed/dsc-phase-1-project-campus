Phase 1 Project


Overview:


Microsoft is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, and they are leader in many fields in technology. They have many rivals and they try not te be behind those rivals. One of the ways that they feel behind rivals is, film industries. Amazon and Apple both have their own film studios, and they make movies, or at least they buy movies from other producers and show them under their names. Although Microsoft is so behind those rivals in this particular topic, they want to start from the beginning. In this Project, I will help them to get some analysis which will help them to make descion Whether they make films or not.

Bussines Problem: 

Beacuse they are new in this industry, they don't have much information about past to use those to make decisions. Moreover , they need to know that what genres they need to start with to have a good and successful start. They are going to invset billions of dollars, and they need to have the best and the most accurate data to have the best investment. I am going to tell them the most rated and voted genre to start they journey in the industry.

Data:

I will use some important and useful existing data from IMDB which provides the popularity and most reviewd movies to help them to make a better decision.

Methods:

With Python and some libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, this project presents descriptive analysis over genres and rating.

Results:

Unlike what they think about a specific genre__Action__to make, Darama genre has the most rating over all other genres. This data extracted from over 146144 movies from 2010 to 2019, and the number of votes in this analysis was very important.

Conclusion:

To have a better start on this film studio, they need to start with drama genre which has the most votes and the most rating(Documentary genre has the mosyt rating, but has the third lowest number of vote of top 10) to grab audience's attention acording to the analysis.

Next Steps:

They need have another analysis about drama genre to find the best data before start making movies. This analysis will help them to find the best director or actors and actresses.
